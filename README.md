## Overview

This repository contains a simple order system for small stores,
implemented using Ruby on Rails.

It is intended for developers who want a minimal, real-world Rails app
that can be used as-is or adapted for specific shop environments.

## Why this project?

Over-engineered

Expensive

Difficult to customize

Small and understandable

Easy to deploy and operate
